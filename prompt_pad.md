1. in @converter_interface.py  we need to use these imports, not remove them. Implement the missing functionality to properly utilize these imported types. Review @ASCII_UI_Implementation_Plan.md , Rewview @ascii_ui.py for context

2. Enhance the code to properly use the imports, particularly focusing on ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion:
  - Look at what's missing in the current implementation
  - Implement proper usage of ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion
  - Ensure all imported types are actually being used somewhere in the code. Ensure to implement these with context of the actual code already implemented.

## ASCII_UI_Implementation_Plan.md

- The converter_interface.py file imports several types from converter_models.py, but some of them aren't being properly utilized.
- Properly use ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion.

### Implement the missing functionality:

See the specific implementation of the update_info_box and other methods in the ConverterDetailsView class to properly implement the missing functionality. Let me view those sections:

See that the ConverterDetailsView class already has some implementation for displaying the converter tier, but it's not fully utilizing the ConverterTier enum. Let me enhance the code to properly use all the imported types (ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion).
