### [TODO]

#### Menu System Patterns (from codebase analysis)

- The menu system uses the following components:
  - `UIMenu` class in `ui/ui_element/ui_menu.py` which extends `ASCIIBox`
  - Menus are created and stored in the `ui_elements` dictionary with keys like "main_menu"
  - Menu state transitions are defined in `config.py` with appropriate entry and exit actions
  - The main menu is displayed via the "show_menu" entry action when transitioning to the menu state

- Implementation strategy for `show_menu`:
  1. Check if menu UI components exist in the game instance
  2. Set visibility and active status for the menu components
  3. Handle any animation or transition effects
  4. Update UI state to reflect menu activation
  5. Log the menu display action for debugging
  - [ ] Implement `resume_game`: Resume from paused state
  - [ ] Implement `hide_menu`: Hide menu UI elements
  - [ ] Implement `pause_game`: Pause game logic and timing
  - [ ] Implement `show_pause_menu`: Display pause menu UI

#### State Entry Handler Patterns (from `.windsurfcontext`)

- Entry handlers are executed when transitioning to a new state via the `_execute_state_actions` method
- Entry handlers are stored in the `_entry_handlers` dictionary (Dict[str, List[Callable]])
- The pattern follows:
  - Each handler is responsible for preparing the game for entering a specific state
  - Handlers should handle exceptions internally and log appropriately
  - Handlers should follow a modular approach for better maintainability
  - Handlers are executed after the state has changed but before the transition is confirmed successful
- Implementation strategy:
  1. First check the game's current state and required resources
  2. Set up necessary UI components for the new state
  3. Initialize any state-specific systems/variables
  4. Provide appropriate user feedback via logging/UI
  - [ ] Implement `show_shop`: Display shop UI and load inventory
  - [ ] Implement `show_map`: Display game map/navigation interface
  - [ ] Implement `show_game_over`: Display game over screen with stats
