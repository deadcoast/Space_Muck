# .windsurfrules 

This file contains all essential codebase patterns, structures, interfaces, and relationships. Refer to this file first when seeking context for code generation, correction, or analysis.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

ALWAYS BEGIN BY CONSULTING .windsurfcontext.md BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY SOLUTION.

### DO NOT:
- Implement solutions based solely on existing code examples
- Skip documentation review even when similar patterns exist elsewhere
- Assume pattern consistency without verification
- Add wrapper functions around existing methods
- Alter existing functionality
- Create your own implementations of existing methods
- Make assumptions about the code - always verify first
- Create actual instances of real classes and use their existing methods directly
- Avoid creating new files when asked to correct a file

### REQUIRED STEPS:
1. Search .windsurfcontext.md for relevant system patterns using #hashtag identifiers
2. Document in Scratchpad which patterns were found and will be applied
3. Only after documentation review, proceed with implementation
4. Verify implementation against documented patterns before submission

ANY CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE WILL BE REJECTED.

## Workflow & Instructions

### Context Source:
`src/.windsurfcontext.md` is the primary source of truth for code patterns, structures, interfaces, and relationships. Always refer to this file first when seeking context for code generation, correction, or analysis.

### Context Retrieval Process:
- When analyzing or generating code, first search `.windsurfcontext` for relevant system sections using `(#hashtag)` identifiers
- Look for code patterns, interfaces, and type structures in the identified sections
- Verify implementation approaches against established patterns
- If context is insufficient, ask the user for clarification

### Architecture Alignment:
- Ensure all implementations follow patterns documented in `.windsurfcontext`
- Maintain consistency with existing type structures and interfaces
- Follow established naming conventions and implementation patterns
- If context is missing, ask the user before implementing new patterns

### Incremental Implementation:
- Generate code in manageable steps aligned with patterns in `.windsurfcontext`
- Review implementations for consistency with documented patterns
- Identify and resolve gaps between implementation and documentation

### Context Maintenance:
- When discovering new patterns or implementations, suggest updates to `.windsurfcontext`
- Format new context entries according to the established structure
- Ensure new entries include concrete code examples, not explanations

### Scratchpad Usage:
- Maintain a `Tasklist` in the `Scratchpad.md` file in this format:

```md
## Scratchpad Tasklist

- [X] Task 1
  - [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Task 2
```
## Tasklist Instructions
- When user makes a request, create a comprehensive `Tasklist` for all steps.
- Update progress markers as subtasks are completed
- Use the Scratchpad to maintain implementation context and track progress
