src/algorithms/pattern_analysis.py

Provides advanced pattern detection and analysis utilities for cellular automata
and colony-based grids. Includes detection of complex oscillators (pulsars, toads,
gliders), Voronoi partitioning of labeled regions for territory assignment, and
colony merging/assimilation mechanics. Each feature can feed into AI logic to help
the symbiotes decide strategies based on established patterns or territory overlaps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. AdvancedPatternAnalyzer
   - Identify multi-step oscillators such as pulsars, toads, or glider cycles.
   - Maintains a recent history of grid states to detect repeating or shifting patterns.
   - Helps AI gauge the “maturity” of a colony based on stable or oscillatory structures.

2. VoronoiTerritoryPartitioner
   - After labeling colonies (connected components), compute approximate Voronoi
     regions for each colony’s center or key point.
   - Useful for deciding how territories are partitioned among multiple colonies,
     or how symbiotes decide who to fight or merge with.

3. ColonyMerger
   - Builds on a labeled colony grid, adding a mechanism to merge weaker colonies
     into stronger ones (or partially assimilate them).
   - Can combine or average “genomes” if you track attributes (e.g., aggression base,
     mutation rate) for each colony.

No usage examples included (per instructions). Integrate these classes/functions
into your main CA or symbiote simulation code.

    Detects complex patterns and oscillators in a cellular automaton grid. For

    or glider-like translations. The user can adapt the detection heuristics
    to match the game’s CA rules if they differ from standard Life.

    Common workflow:
      - Each timestep, call add_state(current_grid).
      - Periodically call detect_oscillator() or detect_glider() to see if a known
        repeating or moving pattern is recognized.
