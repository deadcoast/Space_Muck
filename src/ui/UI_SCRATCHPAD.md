## IMPLEMENTATION RULES AND GUIDELINES

### ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

1. **NEVER E CEED 200 LINES PER FILE** - Split functionality if approaching this limit
2. **NEVER COMBINE DIFFERENT COMPONENT TYPES IN ONE FILE** - Each component type gets its own file
3. **NEVER FORCE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN COMPONENTS** - All dependencies must be optional
4. **NEVER MODIFY WORKING CODE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY** - Add, don't replace

### FILE ORGANIZATION RULES

1. **BASE CLASSES ONLY IN BASE FILES** - ascii_base.py contains ONLY base classes and enums
2. **ONE COMPONENT TYPE PER FILE** - Each UI component type gets its own dedicated file
3. **UTILITIES IN DEDICATED FILES** - Each utility (style, animation, etc.) gets its own file
4. **MA IMUM 3 LEVELS OF INHERITANCE** - Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies

### CODING STANDARDS

1. **ALL PUBLIC METHODS MUST HAVE DOCSTRINGS** - No e ceptions
2. **ALL PARAMETERS MUST HAVE TYPE HINTS** - No e ceptions
3. **DEFAULT VALUES FOR ALL OPTIONAL PARAMETERS** - Make integration easy
4. **ERROR HANDLING IN ALL PUBLIC METHODS** - No uncaught e ceptions
5. **NO CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES** - Strict hierarchical imports only

### IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

1. **DOCUMENT FIRST** - Write docstrings and e amples before implementation
2. **TEST BEFORE COMMIT** - All changes must be tested before moving on
3. **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Complete one task fully before starting another
4. **INCREMENTAL CHANGES ONLY** - Small, focused changes with clear purpose

**I've identified several duplications and disconnections that could be improved. Let me outline these issues:**

1. Duplicate UIStyle Definitions
There are two separate implementations of the UIStyle class:

- One in ascii_base.py (lines 17-122)
- Another imported from ascii_base.py in ascii_ui.py
- This creates potential inconsistencies as the same enum is defined in multiple places, which could lead to synchronization issues if one is updated but not the other.

2. Animation Handling Inconsistencies
While we've standardized animation handling in some components, there are still inconsistencies:

- ascii_base.py has a UIElement class with animation methods like start_animation() and update_animation()
- ascii_ui.py components (ASCIIBo , ASCIIPanel, ASCIIButton, ASCIIProgressBar) each implement their own animation handling
- The animation state dictionaries have slightly different structures across components

3. Disconnected UI Frameworks
There are two parallel UI frameworks:
- The curses-based framework in ascii_base.py (using stdscr for drawing)
- The pygame-based framework in ascii_ui.py (using surface and font for drawing)
- These frameworks don't properly inherit from each other, leading to duplicated functionality.

4. Rendering Inconsistencies
- draw_utils.py contains generic drawing functions
- ascii_ui.py components implement their own drawing logic
- converter_interface.py uses components from ascii_ui.py but also has its own drawing logic, This creates inconsistent rendering approaches across the codebase.

5. Style Application Disconnections
- UIStyle.get_style_for_converter() is used inconsistently across components
- Some components in converter_interface.py don't properly apply the style based on converter type
- Style-specific colors and characters are defined redundantly in multiple classes

6. Inheritance Structure Issues
- ascii_base.py defines a UIElement base class
- Components in ascii_ui.py don't inherit from this base class
- This creates a disconnect between the base UI framework and the specific components

7. Event Handling Duplication
- Event handling logic is duplicated across components in ascii_ui.py and converter_interface.py
- There's no consistent approach to event propagation and handling

**Recommended Refactoring Approach**

1. Consolidate UIStyle: Ensure there's only one definition of UIStyle that's used consistently across the codebase.
2. Standardize Animation Framework: Create a common animation framework that all UI components can use.
3. Unify Rendering Approach: Standardize on either pygame or curses for rendering, or create a proper abstraction layer.
4. Implement Proper Inheritance: Make all UI components inherit from a common base class with shared functionality.
5. Centralize Style Handling: Move style-specific rendering logic to a central location.
6. Create Component Registry: Implement a component registry to manage UI components and their relationships.
7. Standardize Event System: Develop a consistent event handling system across all UI components.
