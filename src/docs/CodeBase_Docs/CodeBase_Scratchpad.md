## Current Task: Fix Type Errors and Improve Type Safety

### 1. Completed Parameter Name and Type Annotation Fixes in Benchmarking Code

- They were passing distribution_type and cluster_value parameters which don't exist in the actual implementations
- The value_generator.py and value_generator_gpu.py modules used different parameter names
- Type annotations were missing Optional for parameters with None default values in multiple benchmark files

**Completed Fixes:**
[X] Fixed generate_resource_distribution_cpu to use correct parameters
[X] Fixed generate_resource_distribution_gpu to use correct parameters
[X] Fixed generate_terrain_cpu to use correct parameters
[X] Fixed generate_terrain_gpu to use correct parameters

[X] Added Optional type annotation for parameters with None default values in benchmark_comprehensive_gpu.py
[X] Added Optional type annotation for parameters with None default values in benchmark_procedural_generation.py
[X] Updated imports to include Optional from typing in both benchmark files
[X] Documented the fixes in CodeBase_Error_Fixes.md
[X] Updated CodeBase_Architecture.md with parameter handling guidelines

### 2. Fixed Optional Type Handling in Unit Tests

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The test_base_entity.py file had "Object of type None is not subscriptable" errors
- The test_fleet_manager.py file had "Object of type None is not subscriptable" errors
- The position attribute in BaseEntity is defined as Optional[Tuple[int, int]]
- The position and current_orders attributes in Fleet are defined as Optional types
- The test methods were trying to access these attributes without proper type guards

**Completed Fixes:**
[X] Added proper assertions and type guards in test_base_entity.py
[X] Added proper assertions and type guards in test_fleet_manager.py
[X] Added explicit assertions with descriptive error messages (e.g., "Fleet position should not be None")
[X] Added explicit type guards for Pyright (e.g., `if self.fleet.position is not None:`)
[X] Updated CodeBase_Error_Fixes.md with examples of proper Optional type handling
[X] Ensured all tests pass with proper type safetychecking if position is None
- Similar issues existed in test_fleet_manager.py with accessing attributes of potentially None values
- Parameter name mismatches between mock methods and actual implementations in test_fleet_manager.py

**Completed Fixes:**
[X] Added null checks before accessing position attributes in test_base_entity.py
[X] Added type guards to prevent accessing attributes of None values
[X] Fixed parameter name mismatches in mock_update methods in test_fleet_manager.py

### 3. Fixed Type Errors in test_pattern_generator.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The test_pattern_generator.py file had type errors with assertLess, assertGreater, and assertGreaterEqual methods
- The assertLess calls had correct parameters but were flagged with type errors
- The assertGreater calls with numpy array values were causing type compatibility issues
- The assertGreaterEqual call with numpy boolean values was causing type compatibility issues

**Completed Fixes:**
[X] Replaced assertGreater calls with assertTrue(a > b) to avoid type compatibility issues
[X] Replaced assertGreaterEqual calls with assertTrue(a >= b) to avoid type compatibility issues
[X] Replaced assertLess calls with assertTrue(a < b) to avoid type compatibility issues
[X] Documented the fixes in CodeBase_Scratchpad.md and CodeBase_Error_Fixes.md

**Note on Sourcery Warnings:**
- The file contains Sourcery warnings about loops and conditionals in tests
- These warnings are informational and don't indicate actual errors
- The loops and conditionals are necessary for testing pattern generation functionality
- The test code is correctly verifying the pattern generator behavior

### 4. Fixed NoiseGenerator Instantiation Issues in test_visualization.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The test_visualization.py file had errors with NoiseGenerator instantiation
- NoiseGenerator is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly
- The code was trying to pass a seed parameter to NoiseGenerator which doesn't exist
- Sourcery warnings about loops in tests were present but not critical

**Completed Fixes:**
[X] Imported get_noise_generator() factory function from utils.noise_generator
[X] Replaced direct NoiseGenerator instantiation with get_noise_generator() calls
[X] Removed the seed parameter from noise generator instantiation
[X] Kept the seed parameter for BaseGenerator which does accept it
[X] Documented the fixes in CodeBase_Error_Fixes.md

**Note on Sourcery Warnings:**
- The file contains Sourcery warnings about loops in tests
- These warnings are informational and don't indicate actual errors
- The loops are necessary for testing visualization functionality with different parameters
- The test code is correctly verifying the visualization behavior

### 5. Refactored Visualization Functions in benchmark_comprehensive_gpu.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The `visualize_single_operation` function in benchmark_comprehensive_gpu.py was too complex
- The function had multiple responsibilities (data extraction, plot creation, file saving)
- Sourcery warnings about low code quality and maintainability
- Complex conditional logic for handling different plot types and data filtering
- Error-prone code for setting log scales and handling edge cases

**Completed Improvements:**
[X] Refactored `visualize_single_operation` into smaller, focused helper functions
[X] Created `_get_x_axis_data` function to extract and validate x-axis data
[X] Created `_filter_valid_data` function for common data filtering logic

[X] Created dedicated plot creation functions for each plot type:
  [X] `_create_time_plot` for execution time visualization
  [X] `_create_speedup_plot` for speedup comparison visualization
  [X] `_create_bandwidth_plot` for memory bandwidth visualization
[X] Added proper type hints including Tuple from typing
[X] Improved error handling for edge cases (empty data, division by zero)
[X] Added try/except blocks for log scale calculations
[X] Updated documentation in CodeBase_Error_Fixes.md

### 6. Next Steps for GPU Benchmarking Improvements

## Previous Task: Comprehensive Fleet Management Unit Testing

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified that we need to implement comprehensive unit tests for the fleet management system. The existing `test_fleet.py` covers basic functionality of the `Fleet` class, but we need to extend testing to cover more advanced features and the `FleetManager` class.

### 1. Fleet Formation and Management Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Basic `Fleet` class tests exist in `test_fleet.py`
- Formation management methods are defined in `FleetManager` class
- Need to test various formation types and their effects on ship positioning

**Implementation Plan:**
- [X] Review existing `test_fleet.py` file
- [X] Create `test_fleet_manager.py` for testing the `FleetManager` class
- [X] Implement tests for all formation types:
  - [X] Line formation
  - [X] Column formation
  - [X] Wedge formation
  - [X] Echelon formation
  - [X] Circle formation
  - [X] Scatter formation
- [X] Test formation change effects on ship positioning
- [X] Test formation effects on combat effectiveness

### 2. Fleet Movement and Pathfinding Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**

- More complex pathfinding is in `FleetManager`
- Need to test movement with obstacles and complex paths

**Implementation Plan:**
