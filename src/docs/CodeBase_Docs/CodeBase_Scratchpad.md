## Current Task: Comprehensive Fleet Management Unit Testing

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified that we need to implement comprehensive unit tests for the fleet management system. The existing `test_fleet.py` covers basic functionality of the `Fleet` class, but we need to extend testing to cover more advanced features and the `FleetManager` class.

### 1. Fleet Formation and Management Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Basic `Fleet` class tests exist in `test_fleet.py`
- Formation management methods are defined in `FleetManager` class
- Need to test various formation types and their effects on ship positioning

**Implementation Plan:**
- [X] Review existing `test_fleet.py` file
- [X] Create `test_fleet_manager.py` for testing the `FleetManager` class
- [X] Implement tests for all formation types:
  - [X] Line formation
  - [X] Column formation
  - [X] Wedge formation
  - [X] Echelon formation
  - [X] Circle formation
  - [X] Scatter formation
- [X] Test formation change effects on ship positioning
- [X] Test formation effects on combat effectiveness

### 2. Fleet Movement and Pathfinding Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Basic movement tests exist in `test_fleet.py`
- More complex pathfinding is in `FleetManager`
- Need to test movement with obstacles and complex paths

**Implementation Plan:**
- [X] Test basic movement functionality
- [X] Test pathfinding around obstacles
- [X] Test movement with fuel constraints
- [X] Test movement speed based on fleet composition
- [X] Test path recalculation when obstacles appear
- [X] Test coordinated movement of multiple fleets

### 3. Fleet Combat Scenarios Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Combat methods are defined in `FleetManager` class
- No existing tests for combat functionality
- Need to test engagement, combat resolution, and disengagement

**Implementation Plan:**
- [X] Test combat engagement initiation
- [X] Test combat stance effects on outcomes
- [X] Test damage calculation and distribution
- [X] Test ship loss during combat
- [X] Test combat disengagement
- [X] Test auto-engagement functionality
- [X] Test combat with different fleet compositions

### 4. Fleet Resource Distribution Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Resource distribution methods exist in `FleetManager`
- No existing tests for resource management
- Need to test various distribution strategies

**Implementation Plan:**
- [X] Test initial resource allocation
- [X] Test equal distribution strategy
- [X] Test proportional distribution strategy
- [X] Test priority-based distribution strategy
- [X] Test resource consumption effects
- [X] Test resource shortage handling
- [X] Test performance impact of resource levels

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phased Approach**
   - Implement tests in order of dependency (formation → movement → combat → resources)
   - Ensure each phase is fully tested before moving to the next
   - Refactor tests as needed to maintain clean test code

2. **Testing Tools**
   - Use `unittest` framework for consistency with existing tests
   - Implement `mock` objects to isolate components
   - Use parameterized tests for testing multiple configurations
   - Create comprehensive test fixtures for reuse

3. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - Aim for >90% code coverage for core fleet functionality
   - Test all edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure all public methods have corresponding tests

## Progress Tracking

- [X] Define comprehensive testing plan
- [X] Implement `test_fleet_manager.py`
- [X] Implement formation tests
- [X] Implement movement tests
- [X] Implement combat tests
- [X] Implement resource tests
- [ ] Validate test coverage
- [ ] Refactor and optimize tests
