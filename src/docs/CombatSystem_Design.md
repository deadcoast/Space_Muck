# Space Muck Combat System Design

## Overview
The combat system will enhance the game by adding ship-to-ship combat mechanics, allowing players to engage with enemy ships, complete combat quests, and upgrade their combat capabilities. The system will integrate with the existing player progression, reputation, and quest systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Ship Combat Attributes
- **Weapon Systems**
  - Attack power: Base damage per attack
  - Attack speed: Attacks per time unit
  - Weapon range: Maximum attack distance
  - Critical hit chance: Probability of dealing extra damage
  - Weapon types: Different weapons with unique properties

- **Defense Systems**
  - Shield strength: Damage absorption before affecting hull
  - Shield recharge rate: Shield points recovered per time unit
  - Hull integrity: Ship health points
  - Evasion: Chance to avoid incoming attacks
  - Armor: Damage reduction percentage

### 2. Combat Mechanics
- **Turn-based combat system**
  - Initiative based on ship speed and pilot skill
  - Actions: Attack, Defend, Use Item, Flee
  - Position-based advantages/disadvantages

- **Damage Calculation**
  - Base formula: `damage = attack_power * (1 - armor/100)`
  - Critical hits: `damage * 2` when critical hit triggers
  - Shield absorption: Damage reduces shields first, then hull

- **Combat Resolution**
  - Victory conditions: Destroy enemy ship or force retreat
  - Defeat conditions: Player ship destroyed or player retreats
  - Stalemate conditions: Combat exceeds maximum turns

### 3. Ship Upgrades
- **Weapon Upgrades**
  - Tiered weapon systems (Levels 1-5)
  - Specialized weapons (mining lasers, ion cannons, missile systems)
  - Faction-specific weapons with unique properties

- **Defense Upgrades**
  - Shield generators (Levels 1-5)
  - Hull reinforcement options
  - Specialized defensive systems (point defense, ECM)

### 4. Enemy Ships
- **Enemy Types**
  - Pirates: Aggressive, focus on attack power
  - Patrol ships: Balanced attack and defense
  - Faction ships: Properties based on faction alignment
  - Elite ships: High-level encounters with special abilities

- **Enemy Generation**
  - Difficulty scaling based on player level and location
  - Procedural generation of ship loadouts
  - Special abilities based on enemy type

### 5. Combat Encounters
- **Encounter Generation**
  - Random encounters while exploring
  - Quest-specific encounters
  - Faction territory encounters based on reputation

- **Encounter Difficulty**
  - Easy: Below player level, fewer ships
  - Medium: At player level, balanced engagement
  - Hard: Above player level, multiple ships or elite enemies

### 6. Rewards and Consequences
- **Combat Rewards**
  - Credits based on enemy type and difficulty
  - Salvaged equipment and resources
  - Experience points for combat success
  - Reputation changes with relevant factions

- **Combat Consequences**
  - Ship repair costs
  - Reputation penalties with certain factions
  - Potential loss of cargo if defeated

### 7. Combat Quests
- **Quest Types**
  - Bounty hunting: Defeat specific enemy ships
  - Escort missions: Protect ships from attackers
  - Faction warfare: Combat missions for specific factions
  - Arena combat: Structured combat challenges

## Integration Points

### Player Class Integration
