- [X] Integrate GameLoop and EventSystem with main.py

### Phase 2: Manager Standardization
- [X] Standardize ResourceManager interface and implementation
- [X] Standardize ModuleManager interface and implementation
- [X] Implement missing ExplorationManager
- [X] Create uniform manager update methods for GameLoop integration

### Phase 3: Context-Manager Connections
- [ ] Connect ResourceManager with GameContext
- [ ] Connect ModuleManager with ModuleContext
- [ ] Implement missing ThresholdContext and ThresholdIntegration
- [ ] Establish SystemIntegration patterns for consistent state synchronization

### Phase 4: UI-Context Connections
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for GameContext consumption
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for ResourceRatesContext consumption
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for ModuleContext consumption
- [ ] Develop missing GameStateMonitor component

### Phase 5: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement ResourceFlowManager optimizations
- [ ] Add event batching and prioritization
- [ ] Optimize render cycles for UI components
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging

## Current Focus
Phase 4: UI-Context Connections

### Current Task
Implementing UI hooks for context consumption:
1. Design UI event system
2. Create context observers
3. Implement UI update handlers
4. Add state visualization
5. Create interactive controls

### Implementation Strategy

- Event system with priority queue
- Resource and module tracking
- Threshold monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

#### 2. ResourceManager Integration
- [X] Design resource update events
- [X] Implement resource state observers
- [X] Create resource flow tracking
- [X] Add threshold monitoring
- [X] Implement state synchronization

##### Completed Features
- Resource event types (created, updated, deleted)
- Flow management (start, stop, update)
- Flow history tracking
- Threshold monitoring and events
- State synchronization with observers

#### 3. ModuleContext Implementation
- [X] Define module state interface
- [X] Create module lifecycle handlers
- [X] Implement dependency tracking
- [X] Add state change propagation
- [X] Create error recovery system

##### Completed Features

- Dependency tracking and validation
- Error handling with recovery attempts
- State history tracking
- GameContext event integration

#### 4. ThresholdContext Implementation
- [X] Define threshold types

- Trigger system with conditions
- Notification handlers and history
- GameContext event integration

### Technical Requirements
1. Event System
   - Use consistent event types
   - Implement proper event queuing
   - Handle event prioritization
   - Add error recovery

2. State Management

   - History tracking
   - Rollback capability

3. Integration Points
   - Clean interface boundaries
   - Typed message passing
   - Error propagation
   - State synchronization

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Individual context behavior
   - State transition validation
   - Error handling coverage

2. Integration Tests
   - Context-manager interactions
   - Event propagation
   - State synchronization
   - Error recovery

### Implementation Notes
