## Test Refactoring Plan: From Mocks to Actual Integration

### Principles for Mock-Free Testing

1. **Direct Component Testing**: Test actual components instead of mocking them
   - Use real component instances with minimal configuration
   - Test behavior, not implementation details

2. **Isolated Test Environments**: Create clean test environments for each test
   - Reset global state before and after tests
   - Use setUp/tearDown methods to ensure clean state

3. **Focused Integration Points**: Test integration points directly
   - Verify actual communication between components
   - Test complete workflows from input to output

4. **Real Data Structures**: Use actual data structures instead of mock returns
   - Create minimal but realistic test data
   - Avoid artificial test-only data formats

5. **Behavior Verification**: Verify observable behavior, not internal calls
   - Check state changes and outputs
   - Avoid verifying that specific methods were called

### Task List for Test Refactoring

- [ ] **Phase 1: Audit Current Tests**
  - [ ] Identify all tests using mocks
  - [ ] Categorize tests by component and functionality
  - [ ] Prioritize tests by importance and complexity

- [ ] **Phase 2: Create Test Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Develop test fixtures for common components
  - [ ] Create utility functions for test setup/teardown
  - [ ] Implement state reset mechanisms

- [ ] **Phase 3: Refactor ASCII Box Event Tests**
  - [ ] Replace ComponentRegistry mocks with actual registry instances
  - [ ] Refactor test_get_box_by_id to use actual component registration
  - [ ] Update test_is_registered_with_events to verify actual registration state
  - [ ] Rewrite test_unregister_ascii_box to test complete registration/unregistration flow

- [ ] **Phase 4: Refactor UI Component Tests**
  - [ ] Update Menu tests to use actual rendering and event handling
  - [ ] Refactor display component tests to verify actual visual output
  - [ ] Enhance input handling tests to use simulated input events

- [ ] **Phase 5: System Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Create end-to-end tests for key user workflows
  - [ ] Implement tests for component interaction chains
  - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Test Structure**:
   ```python
   def test_component_behavior():
       # 1. Setup - Create actual components
       component = RealComponent(minimal_config)
       
       # 2. Exercise - Perform the actual operation
       result = component.perform_action()
       
       # 3. Verify - Check observable outcomes
       assert result.status == expected_status
       assert component.state == expected_state
   ```

2. **Component Registration Example**:
   ```python
   def test_component_registration():
       # Create a clean registry for testing
       registry = ComponentRegistry.get_instance()
       registry.clear()  # Reset state
       
       # Create and register a component
       box = ASCIIBox(5, 5, 10, 10, "Test")
       component_id = register_ascii_box(box)
       
       # Verify registration directly
       assert registry.get_component(component_id) == box
       assert is_registered_with_events(box) == True
       
       # Test unregistration
       assert unregister_ascii_box(box) == True
       assert is_registered_with_events(box) == False
   ```

3. **Event Handling Example**:
   ```python
   def test_event_handling():
       # Create components with actual event handlers
       box = ASCIIBox(5, 5, 10, 10, "Test")
       
       # Track event handling with a simple counter
       event_count = 0
       def handler(event_data):
           nonlocal event_count
           event_count += 1
       
       # Register handler and trigger events
       add_click_handler(box, handler)
       
       # Simulate event
       event_data = UIEventData(UIEventType.CLICK, 7, 7)
       handle_mouse_events(event_data)
       
       # Verify handler was actually called
       assert event_count == 1
