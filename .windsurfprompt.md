# Prompt Pad

This file contains a collection of quick and effecient prompt to help you navigate the codebase and implement new features. Prompts are grouped by topic and are intended to be used as a starting point for new conversations or task generations.

New prompts may be added to this file as needed, but please follow the same format and style as the existing prompts utilizing the CodeBase System Documents.

## 1. Codebase Initialization

```
Review the @.windsurfrules.md file completely. This defines our core workflow and MUST be strictly followed. Populate @.windsurfcontext.md with specific contextual details from our codebase. Transform these from generic specifications into codebase-specific documentation while preserving all workflow components for future implementation compatibility.
```

## 2. Documentation Utilization

```
Refer to @.windsurfrules.md for workflow procedures. Leverage comprehensive documentation in @.windsurfcontext.md and directory tree in @.windsurftree.md for proper codebase integration.
```

## 3. Duplicate Code Analysis

```
Analyze @.windsurftree.md . Systematically search the entire codebase for duplicated files, proceeding directory-by-directory. Document all findings in @.windsurfcontext.md following the clear organization format with appropriate context.
```

## 4. Error Correction Framework

```
1. Examine errors comprehensively
2. Resolve syntax issues in affected files
3. Update TypeScript configuration appropriately
Include specific error details in your response for targeted resolution.
```

## 5. Resource Module Standardization

```
Adhere to @.windsurfrules.md workflow. Create a structured scratchpad tasklist for Resource modules. Focus on correcting linting errors and ensuring type consistency. Convert string literals to enumerated types throughout the resource system.
```

## 6. Context Building

```
Following @.windsurfrules.md workflow, analyze files in the `Tasklist` and populate the @.windsurfcontext.md document. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant src/docs/System_Docs directory. Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically.
```

## 7. Comprehensive Documentation Completion

```
Cross-reference @.windsurftree.md against @.windsurfcontext.md. Identify documentation gaps by searching for "##" and "###" section markers. Create a prioritized tasklist to implement missing sections in the context document. Focus on most critical components first.
```

```
Cross-reference @.cursortree.md against @.cursorcontext.md. Identify documentation gaps by searching for "##" and "###" section markers. Update the prioritized tasklist to implement missing sections in the context document. Focus on most critical components first. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically. When the `Tasklist` is updated, we will add new content to @.cursortemp file, and the user will export it to its proper section.

**NOTE**: YOU ARE EDITING A LIVING FILE, SOME ASPECTS OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDED. YOU MUST ALWAYS CHECK YOUR INTEGRATIONS FOR DUPLICATIONS. CRITICAL: VERIFY INTEGRATIONS AND ADDITIONS ARE NOT DUPLICATES.
```

## Prompting a New Conversation to Utilize the Docs

```
Review the @.windsurfrules file, adhere to this strict workflow to ensure code is implemented gracefully. Remember that you have comprehensive documentation in @System_Integration.md @System_Architecture.md @System_Directory_Tree.md you may review if needed for applicable integration with the codebase. Finally, review @System_Scratchpad.md and continue on the next step on the Tasklist
```

## Implementing Missing Functionality

```
1. in @converter_interface.py  we need to use these imports, not remove them. Implement the missing functionality to properly utilize these imported types. Review @ASCII_UI_Implementation_Plan.md , Rewview @ascii_ui.py for context

2. Enhance the code to properly use the imports, particularly focusing on ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion:
  - Look at what's missing in the current implementation
  - Implement proper usage of ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion
  - Ensure all imported types are actually being used somewhere in the code. Ensure to implement these with context of the actual code already implemented.
```

## ASCII_UI_Implementation_Plan.md

```
- The converter_interface.py file imports several types from converter_models.py, but some of them aren't being properly utilized.
- Properly use ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion.

## Implement the missing functionality:

See the specific implementation of the update_info_box and other methods in the ConverterDetailsView class to properly implement the missing functionality. Let me view those sections:

See that the ConverterDetailsView class already has some implementation for displaying the converter tier, but it's not fully utilizing the ConverterTier enum. Let me enhance the code to properly use all the imported types (ConverterTier, ResourceType, EfficiencyFactor, and OptimizationSuggestion).
```

## ATTN

```
ATTN:{AGENT_DEVELOPER}
MODIFYING ANY FILES IN THE CODEBASE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED UNLESS THE @.windsurfrules FILE IS REVIEWED AND THE WORKFLOW IS ADHERED TO IN FULL. IF THE WORKFLOW PROVIDED IS NOT STRICTLY ADHERED TO, ALL CODE MODIFICATIONS WILL BE REJECTED IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT REVIEW.
```

## Unused Variables & Imports

```
Review these unused variables. Can they be utilized in the relevant module? If so, then the variables are implemented for a reason, and not integrated or developed yet. If they cannot be properly utilized, redundant or duplicate-- then you may safely remove them. This codebase is in ongoing development, unused imports do not always mean they are redundant. If you find the variables can be utilized, develop and integrate them into the module now.
```

## ERROR CORRECTION PHASE

```
# ERROR CORRECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

review the @.windsurfrules and begin working on the Scratchpad Tasklist. As per the workflow, you should seek context in @.windsurfcontext.MD 

## UNUSED VARIABLES RULE

This codebase is in active development, if unused variable is identified, integrate it. We are now in the process of integrating unused variables, conflicting definition types, and codebase consistency. 

WE ARE IN INTEGRATION STEPS: UNLESS DUPLICATED, DELETING CODE IS PROHIBITED.
```
