# Project Analysis Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach to code quality improvement through automated analysis, prioritization, and remediation. The workflow is designed to handle large codebases with numerous linting errors efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Review the `WORKFLOW.md` file to understand the complete process
2. Customize templates in the `templates/` directory for your specific needs
3. Adapt the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to work with your linting tools
4. Configure prioritization and thresholds in the `config/` directory

## Principles

- **Automation First**: Automate as much of the remediation process as possible
- **Strategic Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact issues first
- **Continuous Improvement**: Track metrics to ensure ongoing quality enhancement
- **Documentation as Code**: Maintain standards documentation alongside fix scripts

## Extending the Framework

This framework is designed to be tool-agnostic and can be extended to support multiple languages, linting tools, and project structures. See `WORKFLOW.md` for guidance on customization.
