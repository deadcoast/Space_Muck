# Coding Standards

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase.
2. **Clarity**: Code should be understandable without extensive comments.
3. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
4. **Maintainability**: Consider future maintainers in design decisions.
5. **Security**: Protect against common vulnerabilities by design.

## Code Structure

### File Organization

- One primary concept per file
- Related files grouped in directories
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear separation of concerns

### Component Design

- Single responsibility principle
- Interface-based design
- Explicit dependencies
- Limit component complexity

## Formatting Standards

### Indentation and Spacing

- Consistent indentation (spaces/tabs)
- Line length limit
- Whitespace around operators
- Consistent bracket placement

### Naming Conventions

- CamelCase for functions and variables
- PascalCase for classes and components
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Descriptive, purpose-indicating names

## Coding Practices

### Error Handling

- Explicit error handling
- Consistent error propagation
- Informative error messages
- No silent failures

### Type Safety

- Strong typing where available
- Explicit type conversions
- Interface-based programming
- No implicit any/unknown types

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for readability first
- Identify and optimize critical paths
- Avoid premature optimization
- Document performance tradeoffs

### Documentation

- Required for public APIs
- Required for complex logic
- Update documentation with code changes
- Include examples for non-obvious usage

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Clear test organization and naming
- Maintain test independence

## Security Standards

- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Secure defaults
- Principle of least privilege

## Enforcement

These standards are enforced through:

1. Automated linting
2. Peer code reviews
3. Automated tests
4. CI/CD pipeline validation

## Versioning

- **Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Approved By**: [Team Name]

## Adaptations

Standards may be adapted for specific contexts with team approval. Document adaptations with rationale.
