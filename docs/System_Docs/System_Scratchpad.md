## Current Task
- [X] Implement Core Infrastructure (GameLoop, EventSystem)
- [X] Integrate Core Infrastructure with existing code

## Implementation Plan
Following the Windsurf_System_Integration.md implementation sequence:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [X] Implement GameLoop with standardized update cycle
- [X] Develop EventSystem with consistent subscription patterns
- [X] Create event batching mechanism for performance
- [X] Establish central event buses (ModuleEventBus, GameEventBus, ResourceEventBus)
- [X] Integrate GameLoop and EventSystem with main.py

### Phase 2: Manager Standardization
- [ ] Standardize ResourceManager interface and implementation
- [ ] Standardize ModuleManager interface and implementation
- [ ] Implement missing ExplorationManager
- [ ] Create uniform manager update methods for GameLoop integration

### Phase 3: Context-Manager Connections
- [ ] Connect ResourceManager with GameContext
- [ ] Connect ModuleManager with ModuleContext
- [ ] Implement missing ThresholdContext and ThresholdIntegration
- [ ] Establish SystemIntegration patterns for consistent state synchronization

### Phase 4: UI-Context Connections
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for GameContext consumption
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for ResourceRatesContext consumption
- [ ] Implement UI hooks for ModuleContext consumption
- [ ] Develop missing GameStateMonitor component

### Phase 5: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement ResourceFlowManager optimizations
- [ ] Add event batching and prioritization
- [ ] Optimize render cycles for UI components
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging

## Current Focus
Working on Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - GameLoop implementation
