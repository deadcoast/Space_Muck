- **Central Component**: [Central Component Name] (connects all node types)
- **Flow Pattern**: [Type 1] → [Type 2] → [Type 3], with [Type 4] as transformation points

### 3.2 [Central Component] Responsibilities

   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

2. **[Responsibility Area 2]**: 
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

3. **[Responsibility Area 3]**: 
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]
   - [Task 3]

4. **[Responsibility Area 4]**:
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

### 3.3 Data Flow Sequence
1. [Component Type] register with [Central Component]
2. [Action Type] update [Central Component]
3. [Component Type] query [Central Component]
4. [Central Component] runs [process type]
5. [Process Output] execute
6. Events emit to notify system changes

### 3.4 Key Processes

#### 3.4.1 [Process 1]
1. [Component Type] register with the [Central Component]
2. Connections are established between compatible [components/nodes]
3. The [method name] runs periodically (or on-demand) to:
   - Process [component type] to apply [modifier type]
   - Calculate [metric 1] from [source components]
   - Calculate [metric 2] from [source components]
   - Identify [issue type 1] and [issue type 2]
   - Optimize [parameter] based on [criteria] and [resources]
   - Generate [output records] for the optimized [parameter]
4. [Component Type] query the [Central Component] for current state and [parameter]
5. Events are emitted when significant changes occur ([change type 1], [change type 2], etc.)

#### 3.4.2 [Process 2]
1. Each [component type] has a [rating type] that affects [output type]
2. When the [process name] runs, [component type] are processed first
3. Output connections from [component type] have their rates modified by the [factor type]
4. This enables both simple [operation type] (e.g., [example]) and complex chains

### 3.5 Performance Considerations

   - [Implementation detail 1]
   - [Implementation detail 2]

## 4. [System 2]

### 4.1 Core Components and Relationships
1. **[Core Component 1] (Central Component)**
   - Manages [functionality 1], [functionality 2], and [functionality 3]
   - Operates as a [service type]
   - Key functions:
     - [Function area 1] with [detail]
     - [Function area 2] to [target]
     - [Function area 3] with [capability]

2. **[Core Component 2] ([Framework] Integration)**
   - Wraps [Core Component 1] in a [Framework] context
   - Manages component lifecycle for [functionality]
   - Provides specialized hooks for components:
     - [Hook 1]
     - [Hook 2]
     - [Hook 3]

3. **System Participants**
   - [Participant Type 1]: [Description]
   - [Participant Type 2]: [Description]
   - [Participant Type 3]: [Description]
   - [Participant Type 4]: [Description]

### 4.2 Component Relationships

#### 4.2.1 [Core Component 1]
The core [component type] that handles [functionality 1], [functionality 2], and [functionality 3]:

1. **[Functionality Area 1]**
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

2. **[Functionality Area 2]**
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

3. **[Functionality Area 3]**
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

#### 4.2.2 [Core Component 2]
A [framework] [component type] that integrates the [Core Component 1] with [framework] components:

   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

2. **[Framework] [Feature Type]**
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]
   - [Task 3]

### 4.3 Data Flow Sequence

#### 4.3.1 [Process 1]
1. [Component type] subscribe to specific [event types] they're interested in
2. When an [event] occurs, the source emits it through the [Core Component 1]
3. The [Core Component 1]:
   - Adds the [event] to its [storage]
   - Notifies all [listener type] for that [event type]
4. [Listener type] handle the [event], potentially causing [update type] or [state changes]
5. [Framework] components use [hook type] to subscribe, with automatic cleanup on [lifecycle event]

#### 4.3.2 [Framework] Integration
The [Core Component 2] connects [framework] components to the [system type]:

1. Initializes with the [Core Component 1]
2. Subscribes to all [event types] to track latest [events]
3. Provides [hook type] for components to easily:
   - [Action 1] (`[Hook 1]`)
   - [Action 2] (`[Hook 2]`)
   - [Action 3] (`[Hook 3]`)
4. Manages [process] cleanup when components [lifecycle event]

## 5. Current Issues and Integration Priorities

### 5.1 Overview of Integration Priorities

The following key integration tasks must be prioritized:

1. Connect [Component 1] with [Component 2] and [Component Group]
2. Integrate [Component 3] with [Component 4] and [Component Group]
3. Fix [Component 5] connections to [Component Group]
4. Ensure all [Component Type] register for relevant [event types]
5. Create consistent [process type] patterns throughout the application

### 5.2 Current Issues

#### 5.2.1 [Issue Category 1]
- [Components] have [method type] but no central [process] coordinating these [actions]
- [Component] [actions] aren't happening on a controlled [cycle type]

#### 5.2.2 [Issue Category 2]
- [Resources] are updated both directly ([Component] dispatches) and through [events]
- No single source of truth for [resource] changes

#### 5.2.3 [Issue Category 3]
- [Component] is well-designed but used inconsistently across components
- Many [component type] don't properly subscribe to the [events] they need

#### 5.2.4 [Issue Category 4]
- [Component] depends on [another component] but gets initialized too late
- Components try to use [manager type] before they're ready

#### 5.2.5 [Issue Category 5]
- [Action type 1] action mentioned in [Component] doesn't exist in [Component 2]
- No action to handle [update type]

### 5.3 Critical Missing Connection Points

#### 5.3.1 [Component 1] ↔ [Component 2]
- [Component 1] needs to consistently notify [Component 2] of changes
- [Component 2] needs actions to handle all [state type] changes including [parameter]

#### 5.3.2 [Component 3] ↔ [Component 4]
- [Component 3] operations should consistently go through [Component 4]
- Events from [Component 4] should update [Component 3]

#### 5.3.3 [Component 5] ↔ [Component 6]
- [Component 5] needs to be updated when [resources] change
- [Action type] should affect [resource] usage policies

#### 5.3.4 [Component Type 1] ↔ [System Name]
- [Component Type] need to consistently subscribe to relevant events
- Events should trigger state updates through [mechanism]

### 5.4 Integration Strategy

To address the issues identified above, the integration strategy should focus on:

1. **Establishing a Central [Process Type]**
   - Create a [Class Name] to coordinate all [manager] updates
   - Implement a consistent [cycle type] for predictable state updates

2. **Standardizing [Resource Type] Management**
   - Designate [Component] as the single source of truth for [resource] changes
   - Ensure all [resource] updates flow through a consistent pipeline

3. **Connecting [System Type]**
   - Standardize [event] subscription across all [component type]
   - Ensure all [manager type] properly emit events for state changes

4. **Fixing Initialization Sequence**
   - Create a proper dependency graph for initialization
   - Implement a staged initialization process

5. **Completing [Component] Actions**
   - Add missing action types to [Component]
   - Implement handlers for all required state changes
