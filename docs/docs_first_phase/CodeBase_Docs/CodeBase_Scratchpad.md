## Current Task: Fix Type Errors and Improve Type Safety

### 1. Completed Parameter Name and Type Annotation Fixes in Benchmarking Code

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The generate_resource_distribution_cpu and generate_resource_distribution_gpu functions used incorrect parameter names
- They were passing distribution_type and cluster_value parameters which don't exist in the actual implementations
- The value_generator.py and value_generator_gpu.py modules used different parameter names
- Type annotations were missing Optional for parameters with None default values in multiple benchmark files

**Planned Improvements:**
- [ ] Create helper functions for common operations on Optional types
- [ ] Add more comprehensive type annotations throughout the project
- [ ] Implement consistent patterns for null checking
- [ ] Add automated type checking to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create a type safety library for common patterns

### 3. Fixed Type Errors in test_pattern_generator.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The test_pattern_generator.py file had type errors with assertLess, assertGreater, and assertGreaterEqual methods
- The assertLess calls had correct parameters but were flagged with type errors
- The assertGreater calls with numpy array values were causing type compatibility issues
- The assertGreaterEqual call with numpy boolean values was causing type compatibility issues

**Note on Sourcery Warnings:**
- The file contains Sourcery warnings about loops and conditionals in tests
- These warnings are informational and don't indicate actual errors
- The loops and conditionals are necessary for testing pattern generation functionality
- The test code is correctly verifying the pattern generator behavior

### 4. Fixed NoiseGenerator Instantiation Issues in test_visualization.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The test_visualization.py file had errors with NoiseGenerator instantiation
- NoiseGenerator is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly
- The code was trying to pass a seed parameter to NoiseGenerator which doesn't exist
- Sourcery warnings about loops in tests were present but not critical

**Note on Sourcery Warnings:**
- The file contains Sourcery warnings about loops in tests
- These warnings are informational and don't indicate actual errors
- The loops are necessary for testing visualization functionality with different parameters
- The test code is correctly verifying the visualization behavior

### 5. Refactored Visualization Functions in benchmark_comprehensive_gpu.py

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The `visualize_single_operation` function in benchmark_comprehensive_gpu.py was too complex
- The function had multiple responsibilities (data extraction, plot creation, file saving)
- Sourcery warnings about low code quality and maintainability
- Complex conditional logic for handling different plot types and data filtering
- Error-prone code for setting log scales and handling edge cases

### 6. Next Steps for GPU Benchmarking Improvements

**Planned Improvements:**
[ ] Add more robust error handling for GPU backend selection
[ ] Implement better fallback mechanisms when specific GPU backends are unavailable
[ ] Add more comprehensive logging for benchmark operations
[ ] Create additional visualization types (3D plots, interactive visualizations)
[ ] Implement cross-platform testing capabilities
[ ] Add memory usage tracking to benchmarks
[ ] Review codebase for similar code quality issues
[ ] Create helper functions for common operations on Optional types
[ ] Add more comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase
[ ] Implement consistent patterns for null checking

## Current Task: Import Path Refactoring

### 1. Import Path Inconsistencies

**Analysis of Issues:**
- The codebase had inconsistent import mechanisms across modules
- Some files used relative imports while others used absolute imports with the `src.` prefix
- This caused module resolution errors when importing modules across different packages
- Configuration constants were not consistently available across modules

### 2. Fixed Import Issues in Configuration

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `src/config/__init__.py` to define constants directly
- Added combat-related constants to `src/config/__init__.py`
- Added player-related constants to `src/config/__init__.py`
- Ensured consistent constant availability across modules

### 3. Fixed Import Issues in Generator Modules

**Changes Made:**
- Updated import paths in `src/generators/procedural_generator.py` to use correct path for `BaseGenerator`
- Fixed imports in `src/generators/base_generator.py` to use absolute imports with `src.` prefix
- Updated imports in `src/generators/asteroid_field.py` to use consistent import patterns
- Created test script `tests/test_import_fixes.py` to verify import fixes

### 4. Next Steps for Import Refactoring

**Planned Improvements:**
[ ] Create a comprehensive import strategy document
[ ] Implement a centralized import configuration
[ ] Add automated import validation to CI/CD pipeline
[ ] Review remaining modules for import consistency
[ ] Consider using __init__.py files to simplify imports
[ ] Add import linting to development workflow

## Previous Task: Comprehensive Fleet Management Unit Testing

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified that we need to implement comprehensive unit tests for the fleet management system. The existing `test_fleet.py` covers basic functionality of the `Fleet` class, but we need to extend testing to cover more advanced features and the `FleetManager` class.

### 1. Fleet Formation and Management Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Basic `Fleet` class tests exist in `test_fleet.py`
- Formation management methods are defined in `FleetManager` class
- Need to test various formation types and their effects on ship positioning

### 2. Fleet Movement and Pathfinding Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Basic movement tests exist in `test_fleet.py`
- More complex pathfinding is in `FleetManager`
- Need to test movement with obstacles and complex paths

### 3. Fleet Combat Scenarios Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Combat methods are defined in `FleetManager` class
- No existing tests for combat functionality
- Need to test engagement, combat resolution, and disengagement

### 4. Fleet Resource Distribution Testing

**Analysis of Current State:**
- Resource distribution methods exist in `FleetManager`
- No existing tests for resource management
- Need to test various distribution strategies

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phased Approach**
   - Implement tests in order of dependency (formation → movement → combat → resources)
   - Ensure each phase is fully tested before moving to the next
   - Refactor tests as needed to maintain clean test code

2. **Testing Tools**
   - Use `unittest` framework for consistency with existing tests
   - Implement `mock` objects to isolate components
   - Use parameterized tests for testing multiple configurations
   - Create comprehensive test fixtures for reuse

3. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - Aim for >90% code coverage for core fleet functionality
   - Test all edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure all public methods have corresponding tests

### Test Fixes Implemented

1. **Import Issues Resolution**:
   - Fixed import path issues by using proper relative imports
   - Mocked the EnemyShip class to avoid dependency on missing configuration constants
   - Mocked the GAME_MAP_SIZE constant from the config module

2. **Test Reliability Improvements**:
   - Added proper mocking for ship positioning in formation tests
   - Implemented reliable movement simulation in movement tests
   - Created deterministic waypoint handling for patrol tests
   - Ensured all tests are isolated and don't depend on implementation details

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - All tests now pass successfully
   - Coverage includes all key functionality of the Fleet and FleetManager classes
   - Warning messages are properly handled and verified

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Fixed linting issues (F401, F811) by removing unused imports
   - Removed duplicate import of `patch` from unittest.mock
   - Removed unused `patch` import completely as it wasn't needed
   - Improved code structure and readability
   - Ensured PEP 8 compliance throughout the test file

5. **Additional Test Fixes**:
   - Fixed linting issues in test_base_entity.py:
     - Removed unused imports (patch, MagicMock)
     - Fixed unused variable warning in UUID validation test
     - Refactored test code to use helper methods for common assertions
   - Fixed import issues in test_visualization.py by removing unused numpy import
   - Fixed linting issues in test_base_generator.py:
     - Removed unused import (logging)
     - Replaced utility module imports with importlib.util.find_spec for better availability checking
     - Fixed unused variable warnings (noise_layer2, mock_log, cluster_centers)
     - Refactored test code to use helper methods for common test patterns
     - Improved test structure by creating new test generator instances to avoid caching issues
     - Used itertools.product for cleaner nested loop implementation
