# CodeBase Architecture

This document outlines the architecture, best practices, and design patterns used in the Space Muck project.

## Project Structure

Space Muck is organized into the following main components:

- **Entities**: Core classes that represent objects in the system
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helper classes
- **Tests**: Unit tests and benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Project documentation

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Use type hints for better code readability and IDE support
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
4. Document all public functions, classes, and modules
5. Use consistent naming conventions

### GPU Acceleration

1. Always provide a CPU fallback for GPU-accelerated functions
2. Handle optional dependencies gracefully using `importlib.util.find_spec()`
3. Use conditional imports for GPU libraries (cupy, torch)
4. Implement proper error handling for GPU operations
5. Benchmark both CPU and GPU implementations to ensure performance gains

### Testing

1. Maintain 100% test pass rate
2. Use mocking for external dependencies
3. Write deterministic tests that don't rely on implementation details
4. Test both success and error cases
5. Include performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern

Used for creating different implementations of generators and processors.

### Strategy Pattern

Used for swappable algorithms in procedural generation.

### Observer Pattern

Used for event handling and notifications.

## Performance Optimization

1. Use vectorized operations with NumPy where possible
2. Implement GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks
3. Use caching mechanisms for noise generation
4. Implement parallel processing for independent operations
5. Profile and optimize critical code paths

## Error Handling

1. Use specific exception types
2. Provide meaningful error messages
3. Log errors with appropriate context
4. Implement graceful degradation for optional features
5. Validate inputs to prevent downstream errors
